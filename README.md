# StackOverflow Reputation Builder
A simple toy app to demonstrate the XHR Web API for [FAC 8](https://github.com/FAC8) during the week 3 workshop.

## Learning Aims
* Become familiarised with the [XHR Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) for making asynchronous HTTP requests
* Understand how the StackOverflow HTTP API works
* Become familiar with reading and understanding API documentation

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Open `app.js` in your editor

The app is currently broken because many of the functions are empty.

During the workshop, we will be writing the necessary code to send an asynchronous HTTP request to the StackOverflow API and display the results on the page.

By the end of the workshop, each of you should have an app that at least displays unanswered questions for a given set of tags. If there's time we will also complete the functionality for displaying the top answerers for a given tag.
